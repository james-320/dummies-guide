<small>[`CASR 61.665`][61.665]</small>

- Operate as PIC in any aircraft in any operation (*Includes multi-crew ATO*).

Conduct an instrument approach operation only if:
- The aircraft is equipped for that kind of approach.

Conduct a circling approach only if:

 - The ATPL flight test was passed in the past 12 months and it included a circling approach; or
 - The most recent IPC included a circling approach; or
 - Both:
    - Successfully participating in an operator's check and training system for an operation that includes circling approaches; and
    - The operator holds an approval under <small>[`CASR 61.040`][61.040]</small>.

Conduct a 3D approach only if:

- The flight test was passed in the past 12 months and it included a 3D approach; or
- Either:
    - Most recent IPC included a 3D approach; or
    - A 3D approach has been demonstrated in the past 15 months to an approved person (CASA or Flight Examiner).
- Both:
    - Successfully participating in an operator's check and training system for an operation that includes circling approaches; and
    - The operator holds an approval under <small>[`CASR 61.040`][61.040]</small>.

Conduct a particular instrument approach only if:

- The pilot has completed training in the conduct of that approach; and
- Demonstrated competency to an approved person (CASA or Flight Examiner).

#### Recent Experience Requirements

<small>[`CASR 61.685`][61.685]</small>

Exemptions:

- The pilot has completed an OPC covering IFR operations within the previous 3 months; or
- Both:
    - The pilot is successfully participating in an operator's training and checking system for an IFR operation; and
    - The operator holds an approval under <small>[`CASR 61.685`][61.685]</small>.

Requirements to fly under the IFR:

- At least 3 instrument approach operations within the previous 90 days in an aircraft or FSTD.

#### IPC Requirements

<small>[`CASR 61.695`][61.695]</small>

An ATPL holder can operate under the IFR if they have a valid IPC for the aircraft category.

An ATPL holder can be taken to have a valid IPC during the following periods:

- From the completion of an ATPL flight test till the end of the 12th month after the month in which the holder successfully completes the check; or
- From the completion of an OPC conducted by a flight examiner who holds an instrument rating flight test endorsement till the end of the 12th month after the month in which the holder successfully completes the check; or
- For the duration the holder is participating in an operator's training and checking system for an IFR operation which is approved under <small>[`CASR 61.040`][61.040]</small>; or
- From the completion of an IPC till the end of the 12th month after the month in which the holder successfully completes the check.

If the holder is taken to have a valid IPC per the above and they complete an IPC within 3 months of the expiry date, the new validity period begins from the expiry date (rather than the check date).

If the holder is taken to have a valid IPC because of their participation in an operator's training and checking system, the check is taken to be valid only for operations conducted by that operator.


### Requirements for Issue

- Minimum age of 21;
- Must hold a CPL or MPL with the same aircraft category rating;
- Passed the ATPL aeronautical knowledge exam;
- Completed ATPL flight training;
- Passed the ATPL flight test;
- Met the ATPL aeronautical experience requirements;
- Completed an approved course in multi-crew cooperation.

### Aeronautical Experience Requirements

<small>[`CASR 61.705`][61.705]</small>

Applicants must have:

- 1,500 hours of aeronautical experience;
- 1,400 hours of flight time as a pilot;
- 750 hours of flight time as pilot of an aeroplane;
- Either:
    - 500 hours ICUS flight time in an aeroplane; or
    - 250 hours PIC or ICUS flight time in an aeroplane of which 70 hours must be PIC.
- 200 hours of cross-country flight time in an aeroplane;
- 100 hours PIC or ICUS of cross-country flight time in an aeroplane;
- 100 hours flight time at night in an aeroplane (excluding dual);
- 75 hours of instrument time;
- 45 hours of instrument flight time.

No more than 25 hours may be completed in an FSTD that is not a flight simulator.

## Practice Questions

1. #### Your ATPL comes with an IPC – If you completed the ATPL flight test on 15 Sep 2020 when will the IPC expire?



2. #### You are scheduled to fly a sector under the IFR where the destination will require a circling approach. Are there any limitations on conducting a circling approach under the IFR?



3. #### You are flying an A320 aircraft with a charter operator that does not have an approved checking and training ‘cyclic’ system. It is 92 days since your most recent IPC. Are you able to complete a NDB approach at the destination if this was the only available approach?



4. #### In which CAO would you find information regarding AOC requirements regarding the “obligations in relation to flight category and aeroplane requirements” for aircraft engaged in high capacity RPT operations?



5. #### Provide three examples of required information in an Operations Manual.



6. #### Your company is required to comply with CAO 48.1 and operates A320 aircraft. All operations are to and from home base. You are acclimatised, and have signed off at 2300L after a 10-hour flying duty period (FDP). There is no displacement time applicable. What is the earliest time you can sign on the next day to operate with a planned FDP of 9 hours?



7. #### You are the Captain of an A320 that has landed at Melbourne; the passengers are off the aircraft and the entire crew is just leaving the aircraft via the left front cabin door. Is CASA legally able to test the crew for drugs and alcohol at that point?



8. #### How many artificial horizons are required for an airline operating RPT services?



9. #### When are life jackets required to be carried in a multi engine aircraft?



10. #### An aerodrome certificate is required for an aerodrome for charter and what other operations to that aerodrome?



11. #### As the Captain, you sign on for duty for an RPT service, and after reading the destination NOTAMS, notice that the single wind direction indicator is unserviceable. Can you land at this airport?



12. #### What is the CASA minimum pre-flight fuel requirements for a turbine engine, propeller or jet, charter flight?



13. #### When are seat belts or safety harnesses required to be worn?



14. #### What are the training requirements for flight crew before dangerous goods can be carried on your aircraft?



15. #### Demonstrate use of a manual load chart or electronic weight and balance software – as provided by the training organisation.



16. #### What categories of aircraft require a load sheet to be completed?



17. #### Demonstrate use of routine take-off and landing performance calculations (using tabular or electronic software).



18. #### Describe the minimum approach climb and landing gradients?



19. #### What is the standard missed approach climb gradient and to what altitude must it be maintained?



20. #### During an A320 turn around at a port with no engineering capability, the company approved maintenance organisation (CAMO) asks you to check the engine oil level on one of the engines and top up if required. There is ground support equipment, tools and the correct oil available to physically complete the process. Are you legally able to complete this task?
