## Introduction

These notes have been compiled as a quick reference for Flight Crew who commit aviation on a regular basis. Currently these notes focus mainly on Australian Air Transport Operations, although the author intends to expand the scope of these notes over time.

## Usage

All content has been grouped thematically into three key areas:

- [Airline-specific](/AOC-specific)
- [Aircraft-specific](/aircraft-specific)

Each of these areas is then further broken down into more specific sub-headings. An alternative method to find information is through the [Glossary](/glossary).
