## Regulatory Framework

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is a government body that regulates aviation safety in Australia.

Australian civil aviation legislation is divided into **primary** and **delegated** legislation. Delegated legislation is enabled or authorised by primary legislation. 

In practice, we operate within a 3-tier system (with an additional 2 tiers of supporting documentation):

![Australian Aviation Legislation Structure](/img/aus-av-legislation-structure.png)

### 1. Tier One *(Primary legislation)*

[*Civil Aviation Act 1998*][CAA]

[*Airspace Act 2007*][AirspaceAct]

### 2. Tier Two *(Delegated legislation)*

[Civil Aviation Regulations 1988][CAR]

[Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998][CASR]

![CASR Regulatory Map](/img/CASR-reg-structure.png)

### 3. Tier Three *(Delegated legislation)*

[Manual of Standards][MOS]

[Civil Aviation Orders][CAO]

Other legislative instruments (Directives, approvals, exemptions)

### 4. Aeronautical Information Publication 

[AIP][AIP]

Provided by Airservices Australia. Meets the definition of **authorised aeronautical information**.

### 5. Supporting Material

<abbr title="Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material">AMC/GM</abbr>, 
<abbr title="Advisory Circular">AC</abbr>, 
<abbr title="Civil Aviation Advisory Publication">CAAP</abbr>,
