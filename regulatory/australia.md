## Regulatory Framework

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is a government body that regulates aviation safety in Australia.

Australian civil aviation legislation is divided into **primary** and **delegated** legislation. Delegated legislation is enabled or authorised by primary legislation. 

In practice, we operate within a 3-tier system (with an additional 2 tiers of supporting documentation):

![Australian Aviation Legislation Structure](/img/aus-av-legislation-structure.png)

### Tier One

<small>*(Primary legislation)*</small>

[*Civil Aviation Act 1998*][CAA]

[*Airspace Act 2007*][AirspaceAct]

### Tier Two

<small>*(Delegated legislation)*</small>

[Civil Aviation Regulations 1988][CAR]

[Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998][CASR]

![CASR Regulatory Map](/img/CASR-reg-structure.png)

### Tier Three

<small>*(Delegated legislation)*</small>

[Manual of Standards][MOS]

[Civil Aviation Orders][CAO]

Other legislative instruments (Directives, approvals, exemptions)

### AIP

[<small>`AIP`</small>][AIP]

The Aeronautical Information Package is provided by Airservices Australia. Meets the definition of **authorised aeronautical information**.

### Supporting Material
